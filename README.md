[00:17.76] Long way into nowhere
[00:22.25] Two years from home
[00:26.53] Most days are for nothing
[00:30.34] I keep kicking the stone
[00:42.34] 
[00:52.60] Fly high, overzealous
[00:57.28] Past paragon
[01:01.54] That's why I'm the greatest
[01:05.39] I keep shutting the show
[01:17.39] 
[01:25.23] La-la, la-la-la-la
[01:34.23] 
[01:30.68] Open heart, old cliché
[01:33.41] Two kids in a new town, baby
[01:35.86] Is it my turn? Small-time fame
[01:38.75] Bang-bang and a happy ending
[01:41.06] Down the line, through my veins
[01:44.72] Not ordinary
[01:47.25] Not ordinary
[01:53.25] 
[01:50.83] Oh, is it my heart? Is it my name?
[01:54.42] La-love and a song to carry
[01:56.74] Killing time every day
[01:59.50] Bang-bang, never ending
[02:02.00] Is it my luck? Is it my fate?
[02:05.41] Not ordinary
[02:08.02] Not ordinary
[02:14.02] 
[02:28.03] La-la, la-la-la-la
[02:37.03] 
[02:33.39] Open heart, old cliché
[02:36.19] Two kids in a new town, baby
[02:38.57] Is it my turn? Small-time fame
[02:41.35] Bang-bang and a happy ending
[02:43.70] Down the line, through my veins
[02:47.13] Not ordinary
[02:49.84] Not ordinary
[02:55.84] 
[02:53.46] Oh, is it my heart? Is it my brain?
[02:56.99] La-love and a song to carry
[02:59.48] Killing time every day
[03:02.10] Bang-bang, never ending
[03:04.59] Is it my luck? Is it my fate?
[03:08.16] Not ordinary
[03:10.74] Not ordinary
