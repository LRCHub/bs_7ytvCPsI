Long way into nowhere
Two years from home
Most days are for nothing
I keep kicking the stone
Fly high overzealous
Past paragon
That's why I'm the greatest
I keep shining the stone
La-la, la-la-la-la
Open heart, old cliché
Two kids in a new town, baby
Is it my turn? Small time fame
Bang-bang and a happy ending
Down the line, through my veins
Not ordinary
Not ordinary
Oh!
Is it my heart? Is it my name?
La love and a song to carry
Killing time every day
Bang-bang, never ending
Is it my luck? Is it my fate?
Not ordinary
Not ordinary
La-la, la-la-la-la
Open heart, old cliché
Two kids in a new town baby
Is it my turn? Small time fame
Bang-bang and a happy ending
Down the line, through my vein
Not ordinary
Not ordinary
Oh!
Is it my heart? Is it my name?
La love and a song to carry
Killing time every day
Bang bang never ending
Is it my luck? Is it my fate?
Not ordinary
Not ordinary
